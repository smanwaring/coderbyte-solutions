my coderbyte solutions (note: no regex used)

these are my coderbyte solutions! i only utliize the basic foundations of javascript including: loops, arrays, logical operators, truthy statements, booleans etc. i don't use regex in any of my code since i am not familiar with regex (yet!) 

hope you find these helpful.

xoxo
