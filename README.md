my coderbyte solutions (note: no regex used)

These are my coderbyte solutions! I utliize the basic foundations of javascript only including: loops, arrays, logical operators, truthy statements, booleans etc. I don't use regex in any of my code since I am not familiar with regex (yet!) 

I hope you find these helpful.
