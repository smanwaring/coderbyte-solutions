//Using the JavaScript language, have the function BinaryReversal(str) take the str parameter being passed, 
//which will be a positive integer, take its binary representation, reverse that string of bits, and then finally 
//return the new reversed string in decimal form. For example: if str is "47" then the binary version of this integer is 
//00101111. Your program should reverse this binary string which then becomes: 11110100 and then finally return the decimal 
//version of this string, which is 244.
