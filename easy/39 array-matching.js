//Using the JavaScript language, have the function ArrayMatching(strArr) read the array of strings stored in 
//strArr which will contain only two elements, both of which will represent an array of positive integers. 
//For example: if strArr is ["[1, 2, 5, 6]", "[5, 2, 8, 11]"], then both elements in the input represent two integer arrays, 
//and your goal for this challenge is to add the elements in corresponding locations from both arrays. For the example input, 
//your program should do the following additions: [(1 + 5), (2 + 2), (5 + 8), (6 + 11)] which then equals [6, 4, 13, 17]. 
//Your program should finally return this resulting array in a string format with each element separated by a hyphen: 6-4-13-17.
