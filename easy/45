//Using the JavaScript language, have the function NonrepeatingCharacter(str) take the str parameter being passed, 
//which will contain only alphabetic characters and spaces, and return the first non-repeating character. 
//For example: if str is "agettkgaeee" then your program should return k. 
//The string will always contain at least one character and there will always be at least one non-repeating character.
