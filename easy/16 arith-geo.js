//Have the function ArithGeo(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the string "Arithmetic" if the sequence 
//follows an arithmetic pattern or return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric pattern. 
//If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between 
//each of the numbers is consistent, where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some 
//constant or common ratio. Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric example: [2, 6, 18, 54]. Negative numbers may be 
//entered as parameters, 0 will not be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements.
